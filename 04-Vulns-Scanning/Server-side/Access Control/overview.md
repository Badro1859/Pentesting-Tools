# What is access control?
Access control is the application of constraints on who or what is authorized to perform actions or access resources. In the context of web applications, access control is dependent on authentication and session management:

- `Authentication` confirms that the user is who they say they are.
- `Session management` identifies which subsequent HTTP requests are being made by that same user.

> `Access control` determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform.


## Broken Access Control
-> Broken access control allows attackers to bypass "authorisation", allowing them to view sensitive data or perform tasks they aren't supposed to.  
-> Broken access controls are common and often present a critical security vulnerability. Design and management of access controls is a complex and dynamic problem that applies business, organizational, and legal constraints to a technical implementation. Access control design decisions have to be made by humans so the potential for errors is high.

## Vertical privilege escalation

### 1 - Unprotected functionality

> At its most basic, `vertical privilege escalation` arises where an application does not enforce any protection for sensitive functionality. For example, administrative functions.

### 2 - Parameter-based access control methods

Some applications determine the user's access rights or role at login, and then store this information in a user-controllable location. This could be:

- A hidden field.
- A cookie.
- A preset query string parameter.

## Horizontal privilege escalation
Horizontal privilege escalation occurs if a user is able to gain access to resources belonging to another user, instead of their own resources of that type.
