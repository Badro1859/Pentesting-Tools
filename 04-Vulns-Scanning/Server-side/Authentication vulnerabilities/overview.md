# Authentication vulnerabilities
`Authentication` and `session management` constitute core components of modern web applications. Authentication allows users to gain access to web applications by verifying their identities. The most common form of authentication is using a username and password mechanism. If an attacker is able to find flaws in an authentication mechanism, they might successfully gain access to other users' accounts.

## Difference between authentication and authorization
`Authentication` is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. `Authorization` involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something.

For example, authentication determines whether someone attempting to access a website with the username Carlos123 really is the same person who created the account.

Once Carlos123 is authenticated, their permissions determine what they are authorized to do. For example, they may be authorized to access personal information about other users, or perform actions such as deleting another user's account.


## Brute force attacks

A brute-force attack is when an attacker uses a system of trial and error to guess valid user credentials. These attacks are typically automated using wordlists of usernames and passwords. Automating this process, especially using dedicated tools, potentially enables an attacker to make vast numbers of login attempts at high speed.

### Username enumeration
Username enumeration is when an attacker is able to observe changes in the website's behavior in order to identify whether a given username is valid.  
While attempting to brute-force a login page, you should pay particular attention to any differences in:  
* Status codes
* Error messages 
* Response times

## Bypassing two-factor authentication  
If the user is first prompted to enter a password, and then prompted to enter a verification code on a separate page, the user is effectively in a "logged in" state before they have entered the verification code. In this case, it is worth testing to see if you can directly skip to "logged-in only" pages after completing the first authentication step. Occasionally, you will find that a website doesn't actually check whether or not you completed the second step before loading the page.
