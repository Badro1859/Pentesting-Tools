Occasionally, you may find that the company/entity you're pen-testing is using a program with a well-known vulnerability.

For example, let's say that a company hasn't updated their version of WordPress for a few years, and using a tool such as WPScan, you find that it's version 4.6. Some quick research will reveal that WordPress 4.6 is vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution(RCE) exploit, and even better, you can find an exploit already made on Exploit-DB.
